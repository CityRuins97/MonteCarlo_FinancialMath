# Monte Carlo Method in Financial Engineering

## Abstract

This project will focus on the computational methods (mostly Monte- Carlo) used for pricing derivatives, risk management, and estimating / calibrating models. We will cover the following topics: Monte-Carlo simulation, random number generation, integration using simulations, discretization of stochastic differential equations, output/simulation analysis, variance reduction methods, American options pricing, various financial applications. The learning will be through both theoretical analysis and practical implementation of the concepts.

## Structure

• Sample various probability distributions using different methods
• Estimate integral values using simulation methods
• Simulate paths of stochastic models given by SDEs
• Reduce variance of output using different techniques
• Write simple codes and obtain prices of complex financial derivatives using numerical methods covered in the course
• Apply the simulation methods to risk management/credit risk problems and other applications
